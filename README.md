# Project Overview
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through its own app and is looking to improve sales using data analysis. The company wants its data analyst team to look through historic data to find sales patterns that can be used to improve their strategy. The data analyst assigned for this task must perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of the data to derive insight and make suggest strategies. 
The use of Python is required to work with the data due to the large size of the dataset provided. 

## Key Questions and Objectives
- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.

- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.

- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:

  1. What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?

  2. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?

  3. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

  4. Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?

  5. What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?

  6. What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are 
         ordering, and anything else you can think of.
## Data
The datasets listed below are the ones used for this project. The datasets belong to Instacart and were provided by Career Foundry as part of their learning curriculum. The customer dataset and 'prices' column added to the dataset were included by Career Foundry.

## Tools

Python was used to analyze and work with the data alongside the following libraries:

- Pandas: used for data analysis.

- Numpy: used for mathematical operations

- Seaborn: used for data visualizations

- Matplotlib: used for data visualizations

- SciPy: for mathematical operations
